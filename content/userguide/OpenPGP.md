[OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org/) is a standard for signing and encrypting defined as [RFC4880](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880). It uses a private key to sign / encrypt messages and documents. One of the most commonly used tools for using OpenPGP is GNU Privacy Guard, which is short as GnuPG or GPG.

The private key can be stored in CanoKey, or you can use CanoKey to generate a OpenPGP key. The private key stored in CanoKey cannot be read out. This reduced the chance of leakage of the private key.

## Supported algorithm

* RSA2048
* RSA4096\*
* X25519
* Ed25519
* NIST P-256 (secp256r1, prime256v1)
* NIST P-384 (secp384r1)
* secp256k1

\* Due to the limitation of computing performance, RSA4096 cannot be generated in the card. However, you can generate the key pair and import it to CanoKey.

Note that RSA3072 is not supported currently.

## Default values

* PIN: default 123456, min len 6, max len 64
* Admin PIN: default 12345678, min len 8, max len 64
* Reset Code: default not set, min len 8, max len 64
* Signature PIN : forced // namely verify pin every signature
* Touch Policy: OFF for SIG, DEC, AUT
* Touch Cache Time: 0

## Touch Policy

There are three key slots for OpenPGP, namely Signature key (SIG), Encryption key (DEC) and Authentication key (AUT). You may turn ON or OFF touch policies for SIG, DEC, AUT in the admin applet in the web console or via the `ckman`(a ykman fork) command. The value of touch cache time is in between 0 and 255 seconds (0 means no cache).

### Firmware Version <= 1.4

Touch policy is configured through the admin applet. The technical details can be found in [https://docs.canokeys.org/development/protocols/admin/](https://docs.canokeys.org/development/protocols/admin/).

### Firmware Version >= 1.5

Touch policy is implemented using the User Interaction Flag (Part 4.4.3.6 of the OpenPGP specification). Use a recent GnuPG to configure it.

**Touch policy is only applicable when using the USB interface.**

## PIN Policy

For DEC and AUT, after successfully verifying the PIN, it is always valid for the whole power-up.

For SIG, if the flag `forcesig` is on, the PIN is requested for each signature; otherwise, PIN is only requested for the first signature after power-up.

## Using GnuPG

Please refer to the [GNU Privacy Handbook](https://gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html) at the moment.

```

### Linux

Note that we recommend using `ccid` and `pcsclite` for `gpg-agent`/`scdaemon` to access CanoKey, namely in `~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf`

```
pcsc-driver /usr/lib/libpcsclite.so
card-timeout 5
disable-ccid
```

You should setup `ccid` as in [setup](https://docs.canokeys.org/userguide/setup/).

## Debug and Report

### Linux

You may use `pcsc_scan` to check whether the smart card is detected by `pcscd`. Note that `pcscd` only uses the first smart card it detects, hence if you have other smart card readers in your box, you should remove or disable them first.

You can use `pcscd -a -d -f` to monitor the status of card reader and the communication. The log of it may be reported for troubleshooting.

## Preemption problem

If you get output below when use OpenPGP SmartCard function,

```
gpg: selecting card failed: No such device
gpg: OpenPGP card not available: No such device
```
Check that you have Firefox opened and you are using Windows or installed opensc in Linux.

If you are sure, you can enter "Firefox > Preferences > Privacy&Security > Certificates" and you can see "OpenSC Smartcard framework".
You can click on it and click "unload" or just uninstall opensc (Linux only) and it will be fixed.
